            <h3>BIO</h3>
            <pre>
                <p>
                    My name is Christian Felix, and I am a Senior Computer Science Major.
                    My educational goal is to graduate by the year's end and to attend an internship
                    in my major field. I am also a musician and recently released an album under
                    the name Eclectic Sage entitled "Phantoms" on all streaming platforms. Additionally,
                    I created an art gallery during the latter part of last year.

                    I am open to being called Christian, although some refer to me by the artist name Sage.
                    I have no particular preference in this matter and look forward to excelling and
                    learning the course material with everyone. I greatly appreciate mathematics and
                    my major wholeheartedly despite the challenges because I have witnessed its many applications.

                    Understanding the methodology of data collection and humanistically applying intelligent design
                    furthering my understanding in web design will allow me to implement better designs when
                    creating and executing on creative ventures. This course, along with the others I am taking this semester,
                    will bring me closer to fulfilling my major requirements so I can continue on my journey to
                    create art in this world.

                    The best piece of advice I was offered that I feel remains true through most of my experiences
                    is the notion that "this too shall pass." By putting in the work and effort now, I will see the
                    fruits of my labor in the near future.

                    Christian Felix

            <h2>Programming Skills Section</h2>
            <p>For my Programming skills, I have some familiarity with HTML from making an attempt to code my website for my business I intend on launching called Good Natured Souls. I originally began my coding journey with Python but to be fully transparent, I have not referred to the language for many years and I am more familiar with Java, MySQL, and a sampling of JavaScript. I intend to use my time in this web design course.</p>
